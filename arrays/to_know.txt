You'll learn here:

- some col stuff about arrays
- array methods like 
  -- push (adds an object tot the end of the array)
  -- pop  (removes the last object from the array and tells you what it was.
     It actually changes the array!)
  -- last (returns the last element of the array without removing it)
  -- join (Returns a string created by converting each element of the array to a string, separated by sep.)
      * array.join(sep=$,) → str 
  -- length, size (Returns the number of elements in self.)
  -- reverse (Returns a new array containing self‘s elements in reverse order.)
  -- uniq (Returns a new array by removing duplicate values in self. )
  -- and more... 
- iterators like 'each' (notice, that iterators are always followed by do..end, 'while' and 'if' never had a 'do' near them)
