You are going to learn: (some) string methods

- reverse
- length
- upcase
- downcase
- swapcase
- capitalize
(- center, ljust, rjust - I am not sure about these, but there might be a challenge like: center (ljust, rjust) the XY poem if the line width is XY and determine the num. of whitespaces or something like that maybe?)
