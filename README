Let's look at Ruby from a different direction! Forget the theory (you'll pick it up on the way) and start with programming right away! This mini project aims to to reach out to those who are "wired" a bit differently... starting from the code getting to the theory. This upside down craziness is for the rest of us who want to learn Ruby just as the toddlers learn their mother tongue: on the go!

The basic idea is to learn to code from the code... You'll see some code snippets, little programs that will lead you into the sparkling word of Ruby - from the most basic to more advanced. Don't worry, the theory will be discussed on the way!

Why are you doing this?

Well, first of all I have always wanted to create a series that teaches somehow differently - I was never OK with learning the theory first and doing something looooong after and I am surrounded with some impatient pupils who want to get their hands wet right away. This project will hopefully provide some useful basic material reach out to them. 

You might notice, that some of the challenges are taken in a slightly modified version from Chris Pine's Learn to Program and the Ruby Cookbook. Both of these are great resources for starting/continuing to dig deeper in Ruby.  

Please note, that this is just the beginning - I am still in the phase of collecting some ideas, the challenges need to be sorted and the theory more detailed for the project to be usable for actual learning. At the moment it is just a bunch of random thoughts but hopefully the picture will be whole in the near future! Stay tuned!
