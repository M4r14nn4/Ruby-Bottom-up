#I dont' think this can be used while there is no output that can lead to the next question/riddle, but anyways...
#Task: write a program that asks for the persons favourite number than multiply it by 13 and suggest the result as
#a bigger and better favourite number

puts 'Hello my friend...what\'s your favourite number?'
fav_num = gets.chomp * 13
puts 'What about ' + fav_num + ' It seems to be a bigger and better number. Don\'t you think?'

#things to know:
# - puts
# - gets
# - chomp
# - variables
# - basic aritmetics (can boost the task with some matematics)
# + watch out for putting \ before '-s within ''! (like in 'what\'s your name')
