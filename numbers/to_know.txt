You'll learn here about:

- basic arithmetic

- a bit more advanced arithmetic
  -- **  exponentiation
  -- %   modulus
  -- abs returns the absolute value of a num: (10-14).abs

- generate random numbers: rand() 
  ++ be aware of the range of possible return values here! You have to use rand(11) to get numbers from 1 to 10 and rand(1) always returns 0!

- the Math object
  --Math::PI
  --Math::E
  --Math.cos()
  --Math.tan()
  --Math.log()
  --Math.sqrt()
  ++ something to notice here: PI is not a variable, it is a constant. Variables in Ruby have to start with a lowercase letter and constants with an uppercase letter.

- comparison methods (well, you can compare strings too, so perhaps I should move this into a different section)
  -- <, >, <=, >=
  -- == (tells if the two objects are equal)
  -- !== (Are these different?)
  ++ comparison of strings: 
    * capital letters come before lowercase letters
      ('Zombie' comes before 'alligator')
      ** before comparing words use downcase, upcase or capitalize:
        'Zombie'.downcase < 'alligator.downcase'.
    * another thing to watch out for: '2' < '10' returns false...
      ** '1' char comes before '2' char!
